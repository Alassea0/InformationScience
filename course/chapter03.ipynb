    "Let's go back to Paul Otlet and his index cards for a minute. For me, one of the key takeaways of this story is the simple fact that information never just *is*. Even when we thing we are merely making it accessable through catalogs or search engines, information is, as postmodern philosopher [Jacques Derrida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Derrida) would say, *always already* manipulated. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we could say that at the heart of information retrieval is **manipulating information**, i.e. selecting, grouping, filtering, ordering, sorting, ranking. In fact, `select`, `group`, `filter`, `order`, `sort` and `rank` are the most important keywords in the world's most used database query language, [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), which we will talk about later.\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming terms, this manipulation often boils down to basic **string operations**, like testing metadata for certain criteria or sorting them. And while manipulating strings might seem easy, things can get complicated really easily."
