    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to get started is reading the first chapter of [Modern Information Retrieval](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780321416919), which I recommend you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for now, let's look at another [introduction](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/information-architecture-4th/9781491913529/ch01.html#hellocomma_itunes), the one to [Information Architecture](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781491911686), also mentioned in our [reading list](https://github.com/TomDeneire/InformationScience/blob/master/README.md). Even though this is an introduction about information **architecture** (yet another discipline!), it still serves very well as a concrete example of the different considerations to take into account when it comes to information retrieval.\n",
