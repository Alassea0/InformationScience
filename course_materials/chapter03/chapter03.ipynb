    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to get started is reading the first chapter of [Modern Information Retrieval](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9780321416919), which I recommend you do.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for now, let's look at another [introduction](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/information-architecture-4th/9781491913529/ch01.html#hellocomma_itunes), the one to [Information Architecture](https://isbnsearch.org/isbn/9781491911686), also mentioned in our [reading list](https://github.com/TomDeneire/InformationScience/blob/master/README.md). Even though this is an introduction about information **architecture** (yet another discipline!), i.e. it looks at things from the perspective of information **design** rather than **retrieval**, it still serves very well as a concrete example of the different considerations to take into account when it comes to information retrieval.\n",

    "## Manipulating Information\n",
    "\n",
    "The case of iTunes shows several things, but above all it makes it clear that information (or metadata in this case) never just *is*. It is always manipulated in order to present it in a certain way. So we could say that at the heart of information retrieval is **manipulating information**, i.e. selecting, grouping, filtering, ordering, sorting, ranking. (For those of you who know [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL), notice how this resembles the `select` statement? For those of you who don't, don't worry, we'll look into it later on.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming terms, most of this boils down to string operations, like testing metadata for certain criteria or sorting them. And while manipulating strings might seem easy, things can get complicated really easily."
