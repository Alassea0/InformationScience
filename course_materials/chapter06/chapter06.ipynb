Its goal is to allow you to use Lucene's text indexing and searching capabilities from Python. Still, PyLucene is not a Lucene **port** but a Python **wrapper** around Java Lucene. PyLucene embeds a Java VM with Lucene into a Python process. This means that you still need Java Lucene to run PyLucene, and some additional tools (GNU `Make`, a C++ compiler, etc.).\n",

    "As text indexing/searching is bound to be really slow in Python (so it make good sense to stick to Java Lucene) there is no true pure-Python alternative to Lucene. However, there are some libraries that allow you to experiment with similar indexing/searching software.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of these is [Whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), which is unfortunately no longer maintained. Still, the latest version, 2.7.4, still works fine for Python 3 and can easily be installed through `pip install Whoosh`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [Whoosh introduction](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) we read:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### About Whoosh\n",
    ">- Whoosh is fast, but uses only pure Python, so it will run anywhere Python runs, without requiring a compiler.\n",
    ">- By default, Whoosh uses the Okapi BM25F ranking function, but like most things the ranking function can be easily customized.\n",
    ">- Whoosh creates fairly small indexes compared to many other search libraries.\n",
    ">- All indexed text in Whoosh must be unicode.\n",
    ">- Whoosh lets you store arbitrary Python objects with indexed documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "> ### What is Woosh\n",
    "\n",
    ">Whoosh is a fast, pure Python search engine library.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The primary design impetus of Whoosh is that it is pure Python. You should be able to use Whoosh anywhere you can use Python, no compiler or Java required.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Like one of its ancestors, Lucene, Whoosh is not really a search engine, it’s a programmer library for creating a search engine.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Practically no important behavior of Whoosh is hard-coded. Indexing of text, the level of information stored for each term in each field, parsing of search queries, the types of queries allowed, scoring algorithms, etc. are all customizable, replaceable, and extensible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, Whoosh is quite similar to Lucene, including its query language. It lets you connect terms with `AND` or `OR`, eleminate terms with `NOT`, group terms together into clauses with parentheses, do range, prefix, and wilcard queries, and specify different fields to search. By default it joins clauses together with `AND` (so by default, all terms you specify must be in the document for the document to match)\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code shows you how to create and search a basic Whoosh index. For more information, see the [Whoosh quick start](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) and documentation on the [query language](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/querylang.html).\n"
